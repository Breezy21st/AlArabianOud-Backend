KNOWN BUGS:
1: After logging in, please refresh the page; there's a bug that causes the dashboard not to load up data after logging in.
2. You might experience slow login when logging in; this is due to the backend deployment going into suspended mode due to inactivity. Since I am on a free plan with the hosting site, they temporarily suspend the deployment until there's a request again, and then the deployment will wake up. The wake-up process takes about a minute before you can log in from the admin-app site.
